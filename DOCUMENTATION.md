- The routes of pages are defined within the routes.jsx component using react-router-dom.

### Backend:

- The backend of the project follows MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture ensuring an organized file structure.
- The server configuration can be found within the root server.js file.
- The project contains well-structured folders namely controller, db, graphql and prisma having controller files for each entity, database configuration for prisma, graphql schema with resolver functions and prisma schema model for postgreSQL respectively.

## Features yet to be implemented

- The renting functionality is yet to be integrated.
- The API calls of the product update functionality is implemented. The frontend interaction is yet to be completed.
- The API calls of the transaction history for each user is implemented but it needs to be integrated with the frontend.
- Apollo Cache is yet to be implemented.

## Feedback

- There is room for making authentication and authorization methods more secure using JWT.
- Testing of the project is required for better performance and handling more corner cases.
- The database model can be improved further.
